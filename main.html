		<p class="movieDetail">Wonderful film by Lokesh Kanagaraj. He has executed his extraordinary direction skills really well in this film. I really appreciate the effort they have put for the CGI effects, action sequences and screenplay by Manoj Paramahamsa were incredible in the movie. The setting location of the shooting spot in Kashmir was breathtaking and picturesque. Even though this movie is inspired from "A History Of Violence" novel/movie, it still has new elements added to it and some events altered to keep the story effective and interesting to watch. The action sequences and stunts in this film was particularly better than most movies. The main and supporting cast gave stellar performances including Trisha, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Sarja, Mysskin, Sandy Master, Madonna Sebastian, Iyal, Matthew Thomas, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Anurag Kashyap and Priya Anand. I have to separately mention Thalapathy Vijay, because his performance was just mind blowing to watch on screen, he gave one of his best performances ever in this movie, seriously hats off to him for giving such a wonderful performance, his portrayal of his character "Leo" was just awesome. It was just wonderful to watch him act emotional scenes as well as the transformation scenes, where he was completely his character "Leo". He definitely deserves best actor award for his performance in this film. Anirudh Ravichander also did a great job on this film from the songs to the overall background music, hope he always delivers amazing music  for all his upcoming films. The plot wist and the ending of the climax of the film was was just icing on the cake, as it elevates it to the next level. Overall, it is a great movie and if you are one of Thalapthy Vijay's fans then this movie will be a blast for you, or if you generally like a good action movie and if you are a fan of Lokesh Kanagaraj 's films then also you will enjoy this film. Definetly watch this movie in theaters, if you can because you will for sure have a pleasant experience enjoying the movie. This is a blockbuster film for sure in Tamil Cinema, which deserves to be successful for the unexpected twists each minute and its portrayals of each chacharacter in the story.</p>
